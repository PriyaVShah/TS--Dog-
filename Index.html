      <h1><center>Welcome to Doggies for Rental website, where pet owners, landlords and letting agencies will find everything they need to know about renting with pets. </center></h1>
        <p>DoggiesForRental could help your family make the leap to pet parenthood. Surprise your well-behaved girl or boy with a puppy before buying or adopting to gauge their interaction and make an informed decision on becoming a dog parent. You just might be the perfect home.</a></p>
        <p>Dogs are good for our health, emotional and otherwise. DoggiesForRental is one way to spread these benefits to everyone.</p>
        <p>For a freshman acclimating to college student life sans their beloved pooch, temporary Doggy playtime can offer a sweet and much-needed taste of home, particularly during peak stress points of the academic year, like midterms and finals.</p>
        <p>If this dissuades you from puppy rental, there is always the option of volunteering at a nearby shelter and walking the jumbo version of puppies at no cost to you. </p>
